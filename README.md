# Binary-search-Tree

# Overview

This project implements various operations on binary trees, including:

1. Constructing a binary tree from a BFS (level-order) representation.

2. Performing in-order traversal (both recursive and iterative).

3. Generating different types of binary trees for analysis:

   1. Random permutation of unique numbers.
  
   2. Complete binary trees.
  
   3. Skewed binary trees (left or right heavy).

4. Comparing time and space complexity of recursive and iterative in-order traversal.

5. Validating
